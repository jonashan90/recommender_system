Overview
--------

Our goal is to build a system that recommends highly relevant movies to users.
In order to achieve this, our system must accurately predict the rating that a user will give to an unseen item
as well as display items of high interest to the user.
Therefore, we will be monitoring two key metrics throughout our analyses: root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and precision.
RMSE allows us to measure the accuracy of each prediction and precision allows us to measure
the quality of our recommender system as a whole.
We will be developing a two-model mixed hybrid system, where one model will have a content-based approach and the other
model will have an approximate nearest neighbors approach.
A mixed hybrid system is a system where recommendations from both models are served simultaneously to a user.
Our benchmarks for each model will be the baseline algorithms found in the Python Surprise package.
We will also be monitoring recall as a metric for serendipity in the content-based approach.

Content-based Approach:
The content-based approach attempts to dissect each item into a list of features that best describes that given item.
Then, we try to describe each user using these same features by analyzing the previous rating history of that user.
For example, if a given user consistently gives romance films high ratings, then we can deduce that the user is
a fan of romance films and the user's model will reflect that.
Next, we compute a predicted rating for a given user and a given item by examining how closely their features
are aligned. That is, the fan of romance of films and  romance films that the user has not already consumed will
likely have a high similarity value.
We will compute a predicted rating for every user and item pair that the user has not already consumed.
Finally, we can sort these predicted ratings from greatest to least and recommend the top k items to a user.


LSH w/ Cosine Similarity:
Here we implement the KNN based models, but using only the approximate nearest neighbors.
We used two different variations of KNN i.e., KNN Basic, KNN Baseline. We refer to the following paper for cosine similarity hashing
(http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr04/cos598B/bib/CharikarEstim.pdf) and
implimentation from the github repository (https://github.com/marufaytekin/lsh-spark).
We implemented the Sim Hash for the users using pyspark as demonstrated below.
1) create a random vector of size number of movies having values -1,1 (using a normal distribution)
2) calculate dot product of the random vector and the item rating vector of the user, if the dot product is >0 output 1 else output 0
3) repeat steps 1 and 2 for b bands and r rows
